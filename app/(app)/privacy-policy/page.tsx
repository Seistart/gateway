          Your Rights Relating To Your Personal Data
        </h3>
        <p>
          You have the right under this Privacy and Cookies Policy, and by law
          if you are within the EU, to:
        </p>
        <p>
          Request access to your Personal Data. If you are within the EU, this
          enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you
          and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This
          enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold
          about you corrected. Request erasure of your Personal Data. This
          enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is
          no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the
          right if you are within the EU to ask us to delete or remove your
          Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to
          processing (see below). Object to processing of your Personal Data.
          This right exists where we are relying on a legitimate interest as the
          legal basis for our processing and there is something about your
          particular situation, which makes you want to object to the processing
          of your Personal Data on this ground. You also have the right to
          object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing
          purposes. Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data.
          This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data
          about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the
          reason for processing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request the transfer of your Personal Data. If you are within the EU,
          we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
          Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
          Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
          initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the
          information to perform a contract with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Withdraw consent. This right only exists where we are relying on
          consent to process your Personal Data (“Consent Withdrawal”). If you
          withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access
          to certain specific functionalities of our Site. We will advise you if
          this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          How to exercise your rights. If you want to exercise any of the rights
          described above, please contact us using our contact details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data
          (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation
          to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request
          is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to
          comply with your request in these circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us
          confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal
          Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.
        </p>
        <p>
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
          Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
          particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
          case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
        </p>

          or through your account settings; or by contacting us at any time
          using the contact details. Where you opt out of receiving these
          marketing messages, this will not apply to Personal Data provided to
          us as a result of emails relating to existing or pending hires,
          purchases or subscriptions using the Services or consent to direct
          marketing communications. 4
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold">What Personal Data we collect</h3>
        <p>
          We use Personal Data we collect to provide the Services, personalize
          content, remember information to help you efficiently access your
          account, analyze how the Services are used, diagnose service or
          technical problems, maintain security, monitor aggregate metrics such
          as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and
          track user content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital
          Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information You Directly Provide to Us. There are many occasions when
          you provide information that may enable us to identify you personally
          (“Personal Data”) while using the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal Data from Third Party Sources. In addition to the Personal
          Data that we collect directly from you (as described in the section
          immediately above this one), we may also collect certain of your
          Personal Data from third party sources, some of which may not be
          publicly available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aggregated Data. We may also collect, use and share “Aggregated Data”
          such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated
          Data may be derived from your Personal Data, but once in aggregated
          form it will not constitute Personal Data for the purposes of the GDPR
          or CCPA as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your
          identity. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your
          Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we
          treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in
          accordance with this Privacy & Cookies Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          No Special Categories of Personal Data. We do not collect any “Special
          Categories of Personal Data” about you (this includes details about
          your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual
          orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information
          about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect
          any information about criminal convictions and offences.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold">How We Use Your Personal Data and Why?</h3>
        <p>
          We generally use Personal Data for the following: to deliver and
          improve our Services; to manage your account and provide you with
          customer support; to deliver messages to other users at your request,
          to perform research and analysis about your use of the Services; to
          develop, display, and track Content and advertising tailored to your
          interests on the Services and other sites, including, potentially,
          providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites;
          website or mobile application analytics; to diagnose or fix technology
          problems; to automatically update the Services on your device; to
          verify your identify and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or
          illegal activity; to enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms &
          Conditions (including to enforce rules related to the content of any
          private messages); and to perform functions or services as otherwise
          described to you at the time of collection. A more detailed list of
          the purposes for which we collect Personal Data is provided below. We
          will only use your Personal Data for these purposes unless we
          reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason which is
          compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your Personal
          Data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and
          we will explain the “legal basis” which allows us to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal
          Data, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a legal basis for
          that use if you are within the EU. The legal bases depend on the
          Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use
          your Personal Data only where:
        </p>
        <p>
          We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the
          Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to
          protect the safety and security of the Services; It satisfies a
          legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection
          interests), such as for research and development, to market and
          promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; or
          We need to process your data to comply with a legal or regulatory
          obligation. We may also rely on your consent as a legal basis for
          using your Personal Data where we have expressly sought it for a
          specific purpose. If we do rely on your consent to a use of your
          Personal Data, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but
          this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data? Where we
          need to process your Personal Data either to comply with law, or to
          perform the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to
          provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the
          contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to
          provide you with the functionalities of the Services). In this case,
          we may have to stop you using our Services.
        </p>

          How We Use Cookies And Other Tracking Or Profiling Technologies
        </h3>
        <p>
          We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your
          usage of the Services, including the pages and articles and
          presentations you viewed, time spent using certain features of the
          website, demographic data such as server locations, connection speed,
          and other information that does not identify you. Like most online
          services, we also use cookies, log files, clear GIFs, tracking pixels,
          web beacons, and other technologies that may collect Personal Data.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold">Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          When you visit the Services, we may send one or more “cookies“ – small
          data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and
          let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the
          Site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse
          the Services to us so we can provide you with a more personalized
          experience, but does not collect personal information about you. A
          persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your
          browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to
          the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
          browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears
          after you close your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can I disable cookies? You can typically reset your web browser to
          refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. In
          order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser
          (usually located within the “settings”, “help” “tools” or “edit”
          facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change
          your settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some
          inconvenience in your use of our Services and some features of the
          Service may not function properly. For example, we may not be able to
          recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in
          every time you visit our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Log Files: Log file information is automatically reported by your
          browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Services,
          our servers automatically record certain information your web browser
          sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include
          information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address,
          browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks,
          domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clear GIFs Information (Web Beacons): When you use the Services, we
          may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons or tracking pixels)
          from an ad network to anonymously track online usage patterns. Web
          beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing,
          research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also
          enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you
          visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these
          advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these
          companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had
          requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of
          web beacon tracking by adjusting the settings on your browser. In
          addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our
          users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information
          collected is used to enable more accurate reporting and make Seistart
          better for our users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third Party Services: We may use Google Analytics, Sentry, Segment,
          Intercom, and more tools to help understand use of the Services. These
          tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web
          page request, including cookies and your IP address. These tools also
          receive this information and their use of it is governed by their
          respective privacy policies. You can also prevent the use of these
          tools relating to your use of our Services by downloading and
          installing the browser plugins.

        <p>
          Use of Twitter User Data: If you choose to connect a Twitter profile
          to your account, we will access certain information obtained from
          Twitter regarding your account. In particular we may store your name
          and email address as well as information on the particular profile you
          connect, including your followers and profile picture. This data will
          only be used by us to provide you with the service you expect and will
          not be shared with any third parties.

        <p>

        <p>
          CalOPPA Disclosures: We do not currently respond to web browsers’ “do
          not track” signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection
          information about users’ activities on the Services and on other
          websites. If we do so in the future, we will provide relevant

        <h3 className="font-bold">Our Policy on Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. The
          Services are not intended for children below 16 and we do not
          knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under
          the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register with the
          Services. If you are under the age of 16, please do not submit any
          personal information through the Site. We encourage parents and legal
          guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help
          enforce our Privacy & Cookies Policy by instructing their children
          never to provide personal information on this Site. If we become aware
          that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16,
          we will take steps to remove that information.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold">Links to Other Websites</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy & Cookies Policy applies only to the Services. The
          Services may contain links to other websites not operated or
          controlled by Seistart. We are not responsible for the content,
          accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are
          not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by
          us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services
          to another website, our Privacy & Cookies Policy is no longer in
          effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including
          those that have a link on our Site, is subject to that website’s own
          rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or
          other methods to collect information about you.
